What is difference between tuples and lists in python
The key difference is that tuples are immutable . This means that you cannot change the values in a tuple once you have created it.
As a list is mutable , it can't be used as a key in a dictionary, whereas a tuple can be used.
The literal syntax of tuples is shown by parentheses {} whereas the literal syntax of lists is shown by square brackets [] .
